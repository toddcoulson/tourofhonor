        There are certain expenses associated with the Bucks County Tour of Honor trip such as luxury motor coaches, breakfast, lunch and apparel given to the veterans as a memento of the trip. Donations to the Bucks County Tour of Honor would assist in offsetting these costs. No donation is too small.
